# Waste-Segregation-Model
A Convolutional Neural Network for Waste Segregation into 5 different categories

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`CNNforAWS.ipynb`) that implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for the task of **Automatic Waste Segregation** using image classification.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify waste into 5 different categories such as **plastic**, **paper**, **mixed**,**metal**, **cardboard** and **glass** by analyzing images of waste materials using deep learning.

### Key Features:
- Preprocessing of waste images
- Construction and training of a CNN model
- Evaluation of model performance
- Visualization of accuracy and loss
- Confusion matrix to analyze classification results
